# 📊 Java Sales Tax Calculator CLI

This is a production-grade Command Line Interface (CLI) application developed in Java for calculating sales taxes and total prices for various shopping basket items. It adheres to best practices for robustness, maintainability, and user experience, incorporating features like structured logging, robust input parsing, and dependency management.

## ✨ Features

  * **Sales Tax Calculation:** Accurately calculates basic sales tax (10%) and import duty (5%) on items.
  * **Tax Exemptions:** Correctly identifies and exempts books, food, and medical products from basic sales tax.
  * **Rounding Logic:** Implements specific rounding rules (to the nearest 0.05) for sales tax.
  * **Interactive CLI:** Allows users to input multiple items per receipt and process multiple receipts sequentially.
  * **Structured Output:** Prints clear and formatted receipts including itemized totals, total sales taxes, and overall total.
  * **Robust Input Parsing:** Handles user input with a dedicated parser and provides informative error messages for invalid formats.
  * **Logging:** Utilizes SLF4J and Logback for structured logging, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
  * **Build Automation:** Uses Maven for dependency management, compilation, testing, and packaging into a runnable JAR.
  * **Testable Codebase:** Designed with dependency injection and clear separation of concerns to facilitate unit testing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

  * **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher:** The application is built with Java 11. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or via a package manager.
  * **Apache Maven 3.6.0 or higher:** Maven is used for building and managing the project. Download it from the [Apache Maven Project website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

### Installation and Build

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-tax-calculator.git
    cd my-tax-calculator
    ```
    (Replace `https://github.com/your-username/my-tax-calculator.git` with your actual repository URL).
2.  **Build the project:**
    Use Maven to compile the source code, run tests, and create an executable JAR:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
    This command will generate a `tax-calculator-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file in the `target/` directory.

## 🏃 How to Run

1.  **Navigate to the `target` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd target
    ```
2.  **Execute the application:**
    ```bash
    java -jar tax-calculator-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

### CLI Usage

Once running, the application will prompt you to enter items.

  * **Input Format:** `QUANTITY ITEM_NAME at PRICE`
      * Examples:
          * `1 book at 12.49`
          * `1 music CD at 14.99`
          * `1 imported box of chocolates at 10.00`
  * **To finish entering items for a receipt:** Type `done` and press Enter.
  * **To process another receipt:** Type `yes` when prompted.
  * **To exit the application:** Type `no` when prompted.

#### Example Interaction

```
Enter items for the receipt (e.g., '1 book at 12.49' or type 'done' to finish):
> 1 book at 12.49
> 1 music CD at 14.99
> 1 chocolate bar at 0.85
> done
1 book: 12.49
1 music CD: 16.49
1 chocolate bar: 0.85
Sales Taxes: 1.50
Total: 29.83

Do you want to process another receipt? (yes/no)
yes
Enter items for the receipt (e.g., '1 book at 12.49' or type 'done' to finish):
> 1 imported box of chocolates at 10.00
> 1 imported bottle of perfume at 47.50
> done
1 imported box of chocolates: 10.50
1 imported bottle of perfume: 54.65
Sales Taxes: 7.65
Total: 65.15

Do you want to process another receipt? (yes/no)
no
```

### Command Line Options

You can run the application with an optional debug flag:

  * `--debug` or `-d`: Enables verbose debug logging output to the console.
    ```bash
    java -jar tax-calculator-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --debug
    ```
  * `--help` or `-h`: Displays the help message with available options.
    ```bash
    java -jar tax-calculator-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --help
    ```

## 🧪 Running Tests

The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure the correctness of tax calculations and other business logic.

To run the tests, execute the following Maven command from the project root:

```bash
mvn test
```
